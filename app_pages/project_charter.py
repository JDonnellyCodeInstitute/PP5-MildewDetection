        **Overview**

        Powdery mildew poses a serious threat to cherry production by reducing leaf
        photosynthesis and fruit quality. Currently, each tree requires ~30 min of
        manual leaf inspection. Our goal is to build a CNN-based system that
        classifies leaf images as *Healthy* or *Powdery Mildew* in under one second,
        enabling scalable, real-time monitoring across large orchards.

    - **Objective 1:** Ingest and prepare the cherry-leaf dataset
      - *User Story:* As a data engineer, I want to fetch and clean the dataset so that only valid leaf images remain ready for analysis.

    - **Objective 2:** Visually explore differences between healthy and infected leaves
      - *User Story:* As an agronomist, I want side-by-side comparisons, statistical summaries and montages so I can understand key visual mildew indicators.

    - **Objective 3:** Validate key hypotheses with statistical rigour
      - *User Story:* As a statistician, I want to see t-tests on pixel mean, variance and model recall so I can be confident our findings are significant.

    - **Objective 4:** Automate detection with high accuracy and usability
      - *User Story:* As a farm manager, I want the model to flag infected leaves with ‚â• 90 % recall and an interactive interface to upload new images and download results.

    # Hypotheses
    st.subheader("Project Hypotheses & Validation")
    st.markdown("""
    1. **Model Accuracy Hypothesis**
    A CNN fine-tuned on cherry-leaf images will achieve ‚â• 90 % recall on the *Powdery Mildew* class
    *Validation:* Evaluate on the held-out test set, compute recall with a 95 % CI, and perform a one-sample t-test against the 50 % random-guess baseline (Œ± = 0.05).

    2. **Image Variance Hypothesis**
    Powdery mildew leaves exhibit higher pixel-intensity variance than healthy leaves
    *Validation:* Compute per-image variance for each class and apply a two-sample (Welch‚Äôs) t-test (Œ± = 0.05).

    3. **Image Mean Intensity Hypothesis**
    The mean pixel-intensity of mildew-infected leaves differs from that of healthy leaves
    *Validation:* Compute per-image mean intensity and apply a two-sample (Welch‚Äôs) t-test (Œ± = 0.05).

    4. **Learning-Rate & EarlyStopping Hypothesis**
    Lowering the learning rate to 1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥ *and* using EarlyStopping yields smoother convergence and higher final validation accuracy than the initial higher learning rate run.
    *Validation:* Compare Run 1 (LR = 1 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥, no EarlyStopping) vs Run 2 (LR = 1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥, EarlyStopping) learning curves; quantify oscillations and plateau onset via epoch-wise val_loss variance and peak val_accuracy.
