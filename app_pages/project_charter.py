        **Overview**

        Powdery mildew poses a serious threat to cherry production by reducing leaf
        photosynthesis and fruit quality. Currently, each tree requires ~30 min of
        manual leaf inspection. Our goal is to build a CNN-based system that
        classifies leaf images as *Healthy* or *Powdery Mildew* in under one second,
        enabling scalable, real-time monitoring across large orchards.

    - **Objective 1:** Visually explore differences between healthy and infected leaves  
      - *User Story:* As an agronomist, I want side-by-side comparisons of leaf samples so I can understand key visual indicators of powdery mildew.  
    - **Objective 2:** Automate detection with high accuracy  
      - *User Story:* As a farm manager, I want the model to flag infected leaves with ‚â• 90 % recall so that I can prioritize treatment quickly.

    1. **Model Accuracy Hypothesis**  
       A CNN fine-tuned on cherry-leaf images will achieve ‚â• 90 % recall on the *Powdery Mildew* class  
       *Validation:* Evaluate on held-out test set, compute recall with a 95 % CI, and perform a one-sample t-test against the 50 % random baseline (Œ± = 0.05).

    2. **Image Variance Hypothesis**  
       Powdery mildew leaves exhibit higher pixel-intensity variance than healthy leaves  
       *Validation:* Compute per-image variance for each class and apply a two-sample t-test (Œ± = 0.05).
